# Random osu! Background Generator
Selects random map backgrounds from your osu! songs folder.
Great for jigsaw puzzles in Tabletop Simulator if you and your friend are both osu! degenerates and have nothing to do!

## How to use
* Requires java!
* Select a new image with the `Random` button
* Copy the image file (!) to your clipboard with the `Copy` button
* Set a different osu! folder with the textfield at the bottom

## Features
* Doesn't show the same image twice until you restart the program
* Image path log (`random-osu-bg.log` next to the jar)
  * Path isn't shown in the program so you can guess!
